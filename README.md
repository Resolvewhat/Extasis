# Extasis
AI Mental health interface 
To teach able minded people how to accept reality in a healthy constructive way. 
To be anti-fragile in the face of reality.

# Why?
Today, Amazon can get a package to your doorstep within 24 hours. Any show can be streamed instantly with Netflix. 
Yet, nowhere is there a scale equivalent solution for improving mental health. 
The World Health Organization reports that one in four people will suffer from mental health during their lifetime. 
While various treatments are available, two-thirds will never seek help, which means over ONE BILLION people need our help. 
However, I do not want to limit support and resources regarding mental health behind a wall such as a paid product or service. 
The software created will be free to use for the end user and anyone who accesses the program. This will allow us to not only reach those who would not traditionally receive care but even supplement those who already do. I believe we have the opportunity to develop and implement solutions which fundamentally alter how BILLIONS of people relate to themselves, the world, and one another.

# Impact
Feeling of connectedness to others
Deep feelings of satisfaction
A sense of purpose in your life


# How
There exists a peak state of conciousness, which could function as a cornerstone for a fundamental unifying theory. 
An ultimate goal that we all secretly pursue in a unique way.
The Origin of the projects name, "Extasis" points towards my current hypothesis of how we can get there. The word is from Ancient Greek ἔκστασις (ékstasis) meaning rapture or the state of extreme pleasure, happiness, or excitement.
In modern colloquial terms it is refered to as Flow or Flow State first coined by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi.
