# Why?

Today, Amazon can get a package to your doorstep within 24 hours. Any show can be streamed instantly with Netflix. 
Yet, nowhere is there an equivalent solution for improving mental health. 
The World Health Organization reports that one in four people will suffer from mental health during their lifetime. 
While various treatments are available, two-thirds will never seek help. 
We now have the tools and technology to reach a billion people who would not traditionally receive care.  
By utilizing the most effective strategies for teaching emotional regulation, and identifying which delivery methods are most accessible,
I believe we have the opportunity to develop and implement solutions that alter the way millions of people relate to themselves, the world, and one another.

# Core Values
Autonomy     - Users should have the ability to utilize the software without personally identifying themselves
  (As mental health is inherently very personal)
Cost         - Free. The end user should not be directly charged for
